# Cupcakes
A simple app I made while learning SwiftUI. 

This app aims to delight the user who pretends to order cupcakes for delivery.

The app handles the most important matter first - asking the user what kind of cupcakes they would like! 
The user can customize the number and flavor of the cupcakes, and add on extra sprinkles and frosting.
Then, the app asks the user for more details necessary for the order, including name and address.
Once this information is completed, the user can proceed to checkout. They are shown the price and a button to place the order appears.
When the button is pressed, the app sends all of the order information (including cupcakes and address) to https://reqres.in/api/cupcakes, a
url which just returns the data. 
If successful, an alert is shown confirming order receipt. 

If this app were connected to a real cupcake shop, the user would have cupcakes headed their way. How delightful!
